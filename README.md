# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array
This example demonstrates an uncommon error related to the use of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The expected behavior might be to return all documents, but it actually returns an empty set.  This can cause unexpected results in applications.

## Bug
The bug lies in the incorrect usage of the `$in` operator with an empty array.  The following query is intended to match all documents:

```javascript
db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } });
```

However, this query returns an empty result set.

## Solution
To achieve the desired behavior (returning all documents), use a different approach, such as the `$exists` operator or a query that doesn't rely on the `$in` operator with an empty array.

For instance, if you want to select all documents regardless of the `field`'s value or presence:

```javascript
db.collection.find({});
```
If you want to find documents where the field exists:
```javascript
db.collection.find({field: {$exists: true}});
```
